# ThompsonLab

This repository contains the various scripts used in the Thompson lab. Currently, user-ready version include:

  1) **SirMixaPlot.R** - Current version 7.0 (Electric-Plot-a-Loo) developed for the ImageJ extraction macro
  2) **jetData.ijm** - Fiji ImageJ macro for extracted ROI information across any number of channel pictures
  3) **joinR** - contains an altered jetData.ijm that will generally extract ROI data without a pre-determined ROI. This folder also contains the R script joinR, which will use a 'nearest neighbor' approach to assign each ROI to a specific cell number
  4) **RunnR** - Current version 2.0 (GraphParty). RunnR is an R package for graphing and analyzing line analyses
