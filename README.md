# ThompsonLab

This repository contains the various scripts used in the Thompson lab. Currently, user-ready version include:

  1) SirMixaPlot.R - Current version 7.0 (Electric-Plot-a-Loo) developed for the ImageJ extraction macro
  2) jetData.ijm - Fiji ImageJ macro for extracted ROI information across any number of channel pictures
  3)  joinR - contains an altered jetData.ijm that will generally extract ROI data without a pre-determined ROI. This folder also contains the R script joinR, which will use a 'nearest neighbor' approach to assign each ROI to a specific cell number
  
For version specific changes/program use, consult the annotation within each script
